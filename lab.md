# Problem1

1. (In the datagram)Source port and destination port have changed from [Source Port: 5000, Destination Port: 5001] to [Source Port: 5001, Destination Port: 5002]
2. In the header: TTL and checksum have changed



# Problem2

- node: nodeA sent this update to nodeB
- entries: nodeA sent routes whose destination addresses are interfaces of nodeA, nodeB, nodeC. Since nodeA receives all routes from nodeB, all entries have cost 16 except the one whose destination address is nodeA
